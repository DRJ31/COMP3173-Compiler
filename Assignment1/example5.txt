    Temperature set to 17

(B) First, the lexer recognize "17" as a number by regular expression. Then, it executed command "yylval=atoi(yytext)" to change number string 17 into an integer and pass it to parser by yylval. Because NUMBER is the third part of the rule, therefore, we use $3 to obtain the value of NUMBER and print it out.
