(A) The output of this input is:
A zonefile name 'bar-foo' was encountered
error: syntax error

(B) The reason is the string 'file "foo";' do not meet the rule of quotedname, which is because 'foo' is recognized as a WORD and therefore do not meet the rule of quotedname. And this cause syntax error. However, the program has found zonestatement bar-foo before the syntax error, and it printed out the first line.

(C) I think the error handling of the program is really bad. It didn't tell me where the syntax error is and I have to test every possibilities and find it out by myself. A good error handling should tell me where the error is.
